# UA-CSC453
Repository for student-generated test cases for the University of Arizona's CSC 453 (Compilers) class.

In order to contribute to this git, it is required that you document what exactly your test is testing, and brief detail about how it does this. Submit test cases by push request, and you can expect them to be accepted within 24 hours. Comment should include names of test cases added, and the NetID of the contributor

To Document a Test Case, simply add the next available filename (for iterating through test cases easily), your name & NetID, and a brief description of your test case. Comments within test cases are not required.
